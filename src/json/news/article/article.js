    summary: `BTS, the biggest K-pop act, will be on hiatus through 2024 and
      much of 2025 after four band members enlisted in the Korean
      military. They follow Jin, J-Hope, and Suga who have already begun
      their mandatory military service. The band hopes to be reunited in
      2025. All seven members of the band have entered the Billboard
      charts on their own. The seven-member band recently renewed its
      contracts with Big Hit Music in anticipation of renewed group
      activity after the enforced hiatus. All able-bodied men are
      required to serve in the military for 18 to 21 months.`,

It&rsquo;s a favorite drama trope that many cannot get enough of.

    <p class="text-primary">“1% of Anything” in 2003 was perhaps one of the earliest K-dramas which brought in the “contract marriage” trope, little realizing it would become a huge draw. Kim Da Hyun (Kim Jung Hwa) is a simple and compassionate school teacher. One day she saves an elderly man, not realizing that he is a multimillionaire and owner of one of the largest conglomerates in the country. He remembers her selfless deed and bequeaths his inheritance to her in his will. And he writes off his arrogant grandson Lee Jae In (Kang Dong Won). Jae In, who needs to pacify his grandfather and safeguard his inheritance, decides to enter into a contract marriage with Da Hyun.  </p></br>
    <p class="text-primary">This drama is a golden oldie which has all the cliches and the innocence and naivety of its time. In 2016 it had a remake called “1% of Something” starring Ha Seok Jin and Jeon So Min, who played two divergent personalities who cannot bear the sight of each other, surmounting obstacles and falling in love. “1% of Something” gives you all that you need in a rom-com with amazing chemistry between Ha Seok Jin and Jeon So Min, who also serve some of the best K-drama kisses of all time.</p></br>

    <p class="text-primary">Choi Sang Eun (Park Min Young) holds the record for a dozen divorces. For a woman who ran away from getting married herself, she seems to be reveling in walking down the aisle. But she has her reasons. She is a single life helper and has helped many of her clients sort their many issues by posing as their interim wife. And while Sang Eun wants to retire, she needs to fulfill her last contract with a socially awkward judge named Jung Ji Ho (Go Kyung Pyo), who has been her most reliable client for five years. There’s also the idol star Kang Hae Jin (Kim Jae Young), who wants her to step in as his wife to sort his reputation. Though she is caught in a love triangle, what the men don’t realize is that Sang Eun has a past she is running away from, one that has made her the person she is.</p></br>
    <p class="text-primary">“Love in Contract” is an easy watch. It will make you envy Sang Eun’s luck since she has the most supportive man in her life. Ji Ho, Hae Jin, and even her close friend Gwang Nam (Kang Hyung Suk) are some of her many former husbands. Plus Park Min Young also notches the fashion quotient with her straight cuts and stylish silhouettes.</p></br>

But her world falls apart when her husband on their wedding night confesses he has a heart condition and soon passes away. Even before she can reconcile with her fate, Yeon Woo finds herself crash-landing into present-day Seoul, where she meets Kang Tae Ha (Bae In Hyuk), an aloof and cold chaebol who saves Yeon Woo. In her he finds the perfect bait to comply with his grandfather’s wish to marry him off and secure his inheritance. He asks this rather crazy lady with her quirky behavior to get into a contract alliance with him. The twist is that he suffers from the same heart condition as Yeon Woo’s dead husband. Will her Confucian beliefs adhere to this bizarre scheme?  </p></br>
