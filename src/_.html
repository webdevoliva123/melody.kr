<!-- NCT’s Jaemin Dishes On His Passion For Photography, Upcoming Solo Exhibition, And More -->
<article class="text-primary">NCT’s Jaemin has graced the cover of Esquire magazine!</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">The pictorial that was released on January 22 was conducted under the title “Jaemin from 5 to 7 o’ clock,” featuring Jaemin in a comfortable atmosphere while wearing a variety of Fendi 2024 Spring/Summer outfits including a black suit, leather coat, and denim.</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">In the interview that followed the photo shoot, Jaemin dished on his passion for photography. In one of his previous interviews, Jaemin mentioned that he prefers the time spent on editing photos more than the time spent on taking them. Regarding this, Jaemin elaborated, “When taking pictures, I press the shutter frantically as I have to capture the moment. Then, about three or four months later, when I insert the SD card [into the computer] to find a specific image, all the memories from that time remain [in the memory card]—even moments I hadn’t thought about. I think the biggest charm of cameras is that they capture that time, that place, and the members. It may be a bit of a strange expression, but in some ways, I feel very grateful.”</article>

  <br/>
  <article class="text-primary">When asked if the photos people can see at his solo exhibition are mainly of NCT DREAM members, Jaemin replied, “Yes. There are some landscape photos taken with a film camera too, but I plan to print them out in a smaller size and show them in a continuous series rather than hanging them up in large frames.”</article>

    />
    <br/>
    <article class="text-primary">He added, “Of course I am curious about how people will view my photos, but what I am most looking forward to in my solo exhibition is ‘empathy.’ Just like the feeling I got when looking through the memory card folders of my camera, I want NCTzens (NCT DREAM’s official fan club name) who come to see the exhibition to be able to recall specific moments they shared with us.”</article>

    />
    <br/>
    <article class="text-primary">Jaemin shared, “It has the meaning of being my first solo photo exhibition, but indeed it is an event that looks back on the history of NCT DREAM. I think that is what fans are most excited about when it comes to my photo exhibition.”</article>

<!-- 5 Hair Trends From K-Pop Idols To Give You A Fresh Start In The New Year -->
<article class="text-primary">There’s nothing like the turn of the year to inspire a fresh start, and what better way to ring in the New Year than with a total glow-up! If you’ve been looking to refresh your style, here is some inspiration from your favorite idols. They’re always setting the trends of the season!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">aespa’s Giselle – bleached ends</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Those who remember the 2010’s bleached ends trend may cringe at this one, but aespa’s Giselle brings a fresh twist on the look with her bleached mid-ends. By leaving the ends of her hair natural, she avoids a lot of the split-end issues that bleaching can cause. It’s cool in a sort of edgy, unique way!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">LE SSERAFIM’s Hong Eunchae – under color</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Another split-dye look comes from LE SSERAFIM’s Hong Eunchae, who has been sporting this light blonde color with a layer of black underneath. It definitely adds interest to a simple hairstyle like these twin ponytails, and it also looks great when the hair is down with a peek of the color underneath coming through.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">IVE’s An Yu Jin – messy bangs</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Good news for those who are tired of keeping their bangs styled to perfection at all times! This messier, more low-maintenance look is totally in style. The relaxed look without the perfectly-parted, even strands is totally rock chic, and it works no matter what length your bangs are. It looks amazing on IVE’s An Yu Jin!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">Stray Kids’ Seungmin – warm blond</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">While cool-toned or platinum blonds have been the trend for the last several years, the tide in K-pop is shifting toward warmer, almost strawberry tones. Stray Kids’ Seungmin is sporting a warm golden shade here, but there are plenty of colors to choose from that will suit your skin tone if you want to try this trend.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">TWICE’s Momo – face-framing pieces</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">While face-framing bangs are always in style, lots of idols have been adding them to their look to help bring attention to their face. Choose a finer cut if you don’t already have bangs, or opt for something bolder like TWICE’s Momo for a cool style that’s reminiscent of the hime cut trend but looks even more effortless.</article>























<!-- Here Are The Latest K-Beauty Trends For Fall Worn By Your Favorite Idols -->
<article class="text-primary">Fall is in full swing, but there’s still plenty of time to try out the latest K-beauty trends! There’s a lot happening in the beauty space right now, but thanks to your favorite K-pop stars you can always stay up to date. Here are some of fall’s hottest K-beauty trends – and how to wear them – as presented by your favorite stars!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">1. Blurred overlined lips</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">While the hazy, blurred lip line has been a K-beauty mainstay for years, overlining is taking the space by storm. As shown here on aespa’s Giselle, the K-beauty version of overlining focuses most of the color on the center of the lips – leaving the corners their natural shape. With the added gloss on top, blurring the overlined lip gives the illusion of an ultra-plump pout. Making sure that the shape is perfected is the key to making this look cool and not crazy.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">2. Cool-toned smokey eyes</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Makeup usually takes a darker, more smoky turn in the colder months, and Jisoo of BLACKPINK proves that this Fall/Winter season is no exception. While warm peachy looks have been popular for years, now it’s time for cool tones to have their moment. This purple-leaning eye look with a smudgy dark liner looks fantastic on Jisoo and is a great way to try out the look without going full-on gray.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">3. Ultra-flushed and lifted blush</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">The look you get when you’ve just come inside from a chilly, windy autumn day just can’t be beat, and that’s exactly what Joy’s makeup is trying to emulate. A red blush might look terrifying in the pan, but it’s the key to achieving this look. Starting at the cheekbone right under the eyes, lightly sweep the color over the cheekbone and towards the nose. Blend out the edges with a more neutral pink color to mesh it all together.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">4. Inner corner liner</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Using eyeliner to elongate the outer eye is a classic makeup trick, but did you know that the same can be done to the inner corner for some extra oomph? Dahyun has been rocking this look for a while – simply take a dark brown or black pencil liner and carefully extend the line from your top lash through the inner corner and all the way down to your bottom lash line. Just be careful not to poke your eye in the process!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">5. Toned-down aegyosal</article>

<article class="text-primary">While aegyosal (the little pad of fat beneath the eyes) have long been a key part of the Korean makeup style and probably always will be, lately the approach has been a little more pared-back. Where once makeup artists used to pile on shimmer and sparkle, now the aegyosal is carefully contoured and highlighted with a subtle matte or satin eyeshadow. The result is more subtle and natural-looking while still staying true to the K-beauty look.</article>

<!-- 3 Reasons To Watch Revenge Romance K-Drama “Love Song For Illusion” -->
<article class="text-primary">Revenge and love make strange bedfellows but remain a favorite genre in K-dramas. “Love Song for Illusion,” adapted from a webtoon, is a throbbing love story between a crown prince and an assassin but with a twist. Crown Prince Sajo Hyun (Park Ji Hoon) suffers from a personality disorder. He has an alter ego named Ak Hee, who is at loggerheads with Sajo Hyun’s reticent and sensitive personality. Then there’s Yeon Wol (Hong Ye Ji), whose life fell apart as a child when her father, the former king, was murdered in front of her eyes as well as her mother. The little girl swears to avenge her family and becomes an assassin. Fate works in strange ways when she finds herself mysteriously becoming the Crown Prince’s concubine, the very man whose family she hates. What complicates matters is that Yeon Wol finds herself developing fondness and deep affection for Sajo Hyun, who resents her, since he regards her as Ak Hee’s woman. If this piques your interest, here are three reasons for you to watch “Love Song for Illusion”!</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">Breaking gender stereotypes</article>
<br/>

  class="article_post"

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">There is always a specific gender portrayal, especially when it comes to historical dramas. The men are usually shown as valiant, masters in the art of artillery and smart statesmen, who have little or no time for the artistic pleasures in life other than their material conquests, with a bit of time for romance. However, Sajo Hyun is the opposite. He would rather spend his time in the drapery than go on hunting sprees. He is a dress designer, and ever since he was a little boy, all he has wanted to do was design clothes. This of course made him the object of derision, especially from his father, who cruelly chastises him saying, “All you ever do is draw headless men.” Sajo Hyun is asked to “man up,” which results in watching bloodshed and violence, and that’s when he develops mental health issues. When he grows up, his creations, fabrics, and drapery are his refuge from the chaos of his own life as crown prince, and it’s obvious he’d rather design than sit in court. It’s interesting to note that a royal-turned-fashion designer is not something you commonly see in the drama space.</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">On the other hand, Yeon Wol was a child who enjoyed the martial arts, and her parents nurtured that aspect. Her father even proudly presents her with a mini sword, acknowledging that even though she is a girl, she is destined to lead. When her family is massacred in front of her own eyes, you can see the burning flames for revenge. She joins rebels, and her skills are way more advanced than the men she defeats. She is the one who tells Sajo Hyun that there is nothing to be ashamed of regarding his skills as a designer, and he tells her, “You think it is strange that a man likes to meddle with fabric and sew.” Her response is that men and women should do what they enjoy doing. She is also far more astute and wise than Sajo Hyun as well as fearless. The way these two characters are portrayed and the breaking of gender stereotypes make the show pretty interesting and refreshing.</article>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_large_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">Awesome choreography, stunts, and dance sequences</article>

  class="article_post"
/>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">The scale of production is usually grand in historical dramas, but it is the choreography in “Love Song for Illusion” which deserves a mention. Yeon Wol, who has to hide her identity, has taken on the name of Kyera and is also a member of a dance troupe. It’s her way to get familiar with the palace and get close to Sajo Hyun’s father, the debauched king. The drama contains fluid moments and flowing costumes to the beats of tense music, and the dance sequences are well orchestrated, blending in Salpuri (a Korean traditional performance) along with modern movements. The fight sequences, which bring forth martial arts and parkour, are well choreographed, and it’s again Yeon Wol’s character who is the one executing it, and she makes it very convincing. Though the story gets stretched at times, nonetheless it keeps you engaged as you wonder where this ill-fated relationship will lead Sajo Hyun and Yeon Wol.</article>


















<!-- 5 Times In Episodes 3-4 Of “Knight Flower” When Lee Jong Won Gets A Hint On Honey Lee’s Identity -->

<article class="text-primary">“Knight Flower” just keeps getting better and better. The shorter episode count allows things to zip forward in a fun but rational progression. Jo Yeo Hwa (Honey Lee) and Park Soo Ho (Lee Jong Won) have met twice now, with both equally irritated and flustered by the other. But while he’s trying to figure her out, she’s equally eager to avoid him. Things come to a head when they find themselves constantly running into each other in and out of disguise. But will that be enough for Soo Ho to put the clues together?</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Here are five times from episodes 3 and 4 when Park Soo Ho gets a hint of Jo Yeo Hwa’s identity.</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary font-bold">Warning: spoilers for episodes 3-4 below.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Yeo Hwa’s journey to the temple is cut short by a group of poor folk who are trying to steal the sacks of rice she’s bringing with her. Yeo Hwa’s happy to share it with them, but things get messy when Soo Ho and his brother, the Royal Secretary Park Yoon Hak (Lee Ki Woo), run into them on the same path and assume that the beggars are holding them prisoner. Yeo Hwa distracts Soo Ho (who would have fully broken the men’s bones if she hadn’t), and he “rescues” her, allowing the men enough time to flee. But like Yeo Hwa, Soo Ho doesn’t seem to have had much physical contact with the opposite sex because he drops her immediately. And perhaps it’s for the better. Because Soo Ho’s no fool.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">He replays their interaction as he leaves and notes that rather than being in danger from the beggars, Yeo Hwa seemed to know exactly what she was doing. Yoon Hak’s too busy making heart eyes at Yeo Hwa’s brilliant, talented maid Yeon Sun (Park Se Hyun), so he’s of no help in the analysis quarter. Soo Ho doesn’t know why the Yeo Hwa he’s met doesn’t align with the tales of the virtuous daughter-in-law of the Seok family that he’s heard from Yoon Hak and everyone else, but he has bigger fish to fry and a thief he doesn’t want to catch.</article>

<article class="text-primary">Yeo Hwa returns home to the message Soo Ho left at the Myungdo Inn, warning her that he has to hunt her down and not to appear before him again. He tells her to return the painting as soon as possible, and Yeo Hwa irritably stalks down to the Minister of Finance’s residence in disguise, meaning to slip in, drop it off, and slip out. Only, Soo Ho’s waiting for her there.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">They engage in a fine display of swordsmanship, with Soo Ho both impressed and wondering why she showed up to return it. The fight reaches a rapid end when Yeo Hwa accidentally slices the tie off his shirt and is blinded by abs. He tries to cover himself, and she takes that opportunity to flee, leaving Soo Ho with only nightmares where the strange widow of the Seok family merges with the mysterious woman who steals paintings and saves children.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Soo Ho really doesn’t want Yeo Hwa to be captured so he pretends to have lost the thief when he had ample chance to chase after her. He’s assigned to watch over another gathering of noble women, headed by the Minister of Finance’s lovely wife, who are planning to give alms to the poor. Yeo Hwa is forced to attend and bears with her mother-in-law using her as a tool of social ascent, with the conversation getting uglier and uglier. In a competition on who has the better daughter-in-law, the Minister of Personnel’s wife argues that the most virtuous things a widow can do is end her life and join her husband, sending a pointed look at her daughter-in-law’s direction. It’s such an ugly conversation, but Soo Ho seems to see a quiet strength in Yeo Hwa. There’s something he recognizes about her, but he doesn’t know why.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Yeo Hwa is further disheartened during the almsgiving to the poor, where she can only ladle a measly spoonful of porridge in their bowls and give them a handful of rice. She hates seeing them suffer. When an old woman begging the guards to find her lost granddaughter is shoved away without food, Yeo Hwa seeks her out only to see that someone’s messed with her ramshackle house and that it’s about to collapse. Without thinking, she runs in to shield the woman. And without thinking, Soo Ho runs in to shield her, taking the brunt of the injury. Yeo Hwa stares at him with her face partially covered, and something clicks in Soo Ho’s head. He limps away while Yeo Hwa’s mother-in-law tries to give her hell, only to shut up when the Minister of Finance’s wife praises her courage.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">That night, Yeo Hwa can’t stop thinking about all the poor on the edge of town and goes there in disguise with a bag of rice that she happily gives away. But trouble’s waiting for her there. First off, Soo Ho’s already there, trying to rebuild the old woman’s house despite his wounded shoulder because he’s a big softie. Second, Guild head Kang Pil Jik’s (Jo Jae Yoon’s) hired muscles are scouring the huts for a missing girl. It turns out that they’ve been kidnapping children from poor parts of town to traffic. The girl is the old woman’s missing granddaughter. Yeo Hwa immediately steps up to protect the girl, but the men just take the old woman hostage. So, Yeo Hwa offers herself as hostage. And that’s when an equally masked Soo Ho steps on the scene.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Yeo Hwa’s all “what the hell?” when he comes out of nowhere and says that he’ll be the hostage. They bicker back and forth on why the other is here and why they keep running into each other and insist that they’re not working together to Kang Pil Jik’s very confused men. But there’s a shared camaraderie between the two, and even while they argue, their focus is to protect the innocent around them, and that’s exactly what they do, sending the men running (while pretending to fight each other). Yeo Hwa makes a run for it too but Soo Ho catches up with her and ditches his mask. It only takes him one look at her face to put it together with Yeo Hwa’s half-covered face. And he smiles and lets her go.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Everything Yeo Hwa knows about fighting could fill several books, but her knowledge of romance and men could sit on the head of a pin. She hasn’t been able to keep her head straight ever since she saw his abs, and every time he grips her wrist, she tries to run in the other direction. Soo Ho finds it fascinating though he isn’t thinking of romance at the moment. When he stops by the Myungdo Inn to repair the scrollhead of the painting Yeo Hwa stole (and broke in their fight), he almost grins to see her hiding. They fight over who should return the repaired painting once more and accidentally crack the painting some more, and flower petals suddenly come out of the hollow within. Soo Ho and Yeo Hwa have no idea why they’re there, but they absolutely have a moment watching them fall.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">There’s something hilarious about these two supposed archenemies sitting down and critiquing the other’s crime-stopping abilities. Yeo Hwa confides in him that Kang Pil Jik is trafficking children and suggests that they work together, but Soo Ho shoots that down immediately saying that it’s his job as a member of the capital guard. She’s just a figure in a mask, he says. Yeo Hwa’s hurt by it, even though part of her knows it’s true. But Soo Ho doesn’t fare well in his attempt to go by the book. He tries to bring Kang Pil Jik for questioning, enlisting even his boss in the process. But Pil Jik merely pulls on his connections and is released, leaving Soo Ho in his boss’s bad books, with no power, and with some powerful enemies. Yeo Hwa hears that he’s failed and sneaks in herself to rescue the children, but Soo Ho slips in right after her and asks why she isn’t leaving the job to him, and we’re left at that cliffhanger!</article>

<article class="text-primary">Soo Ho’s an interesting man in the sense that he’s very aware of the injustice around him and tries to correct it, but he’s so by-the-book that he ends up making enemies. He doesn’t play the game the way his brother or even the King does, and he has no idea that there’s a web of corruption in the city with Left State Minister Seok Ji Sang (Kim Sang Joong) at its very heart. Soo Ho’s only weakness seems to be Yeo Hwa, whose identity he’s protecting with everything in him both in and out of disguise. When it comes to her, he’s the worst cop in the city. Just never seems to see her. It’s adorable.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">I can’t wait for them to fall hard, especially because Yeo Hwa’s amazing. The more we see of how widowed women and women in general were treated during the Joseon period, the worse it gets. These women depend on men for validation, finances, and security, so they cut each other down whenever they can in a game of “virtue,” trying to be perfect for men who’ve never followed even a single rule. It’s heartbreaking because life is a prison to them and has turned women like Yeo Hwa’s mother-in-law into rigid, poisonous creatures of habit. The fact that Yeo Hwa continues to maintain her compassion for others in the midst of it all is a testament to her spirit. With the characters all in play and Yeo Hwa blissfully unaware that Soo Ho knows her secret, next week promises to be quite the ride. Will things get romantic? Friday will tell!</article>

<!-- 5 K-Dramas With Sweet Yet Strong Couples To Watch If You Miss “A Good Day To Be A Dog” -->
<article class="text-primary">Since “A Good Day to Be a Dog” ended, many of us are suffering from the withdrawal of Han Hae Na (Park Gyu Young) and Jin Seo Won’s (Cha Eun Woo’s) unique and charming romance as they became one of the public’s favorite sweethearts due to their resilience, loveliness, and funny interactions.

<article class="text-primary">
  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be able to tell apart the truths from the lies? It surely would make things easier in many aspects, especially when it comes to love. But to Mok Sol Hee (Kim So Hyun), who is able to literally discern when people are telling lies, this ability isn’t always so beneficial, though she definitely has found practical uses for it. To her, hearing people lying has become a very common thing, which is why when she meets Kim Do Ha (Hwang Minhyun), a handsome but mysterious composer who hides his face and a big secret from his past, she is greatly surprised to realize that he never lies.

  What begins as just a random encounter for the two protagonists soon turns into the fate that was preparing to bring them back together.

  Sometimes reality can be harder than any other obstacle, and nobody understands this better than Cha Soo Hyun (Song Hye Kyo). She has to not only put up with an overbearing political family but also carry the responsibility of bringing back to business the hotel she received as her only alimony after a disastrous divorce. So she travels to Cuba, where she is preparing to obtain a new hotel in order to make her way out of her dreadful circumstances. But what she never expects is to meet a man who will turn her life upside down.

  The last thing on Soo Hyun’s mind is to fall in love, let alone fall for Kim Jin Hyun (Park Bo Gum), a younger man whose career is just beginning. He has no connections and is not afraid to fight for their love despite having all the odds against them. Through overcoming many prejudices and skimmings, they find the courage to live in love and live their lives to the fullest. Though this drama doesn’t exactly have any kind of magic, special abilities, or curses from the past, the fantasy-like scenarios full of beautiful sunsets, cheerful music, and a handsome young photographer make this 2018 drama worthy of being part of this list.

  Some people dream of meeting their idols, and others are even able to do it, but when the hero you want to meet is just a cartoon character, that dream remains just that. Though it wasn’t Oh Yeon Joo’s (Han Hyo Joo’s) actual dream to meet Kang Chul (Lee Jong Suk), the main character in her father’s popular comic, she somehow ends up not only face to face with him, but she also saves his life. After that, she continues being dragged back into the comic, going back and forth between those two worlds.

  Kang Chul is everything that a main character should be: handsome, rich, smart, and unfortunately, fictional. But he isn’t aware of this until he meets Oh Yeon Joo, a surgeon who appears out of nowhere every time he seems to be in danger. This makes her appear highly suspicious but at the same time very intriguing, and he quickly convinces himself that she might be the key to his life. There may be couples who have to fight crazy ex-lovers, society prejudices, and sometimes even deities, but in this drama they have to fight with two different dimensions, which makes them unique in their own way and completely worth watching.

  Some robots are built in order to have a big resemblance to humans, but what about a human trying to impersonate a robot? As absurd as it seems, this is exactly what Jo Ji Ah (Chae Soo Bin) has to do in order to recover from all of her failed endeavors as an inventor. Though she hasn’t succeeded yet, she is confident in her creativity and that one day someone will recognize the brilliant mind she has. In the meantime, she pretends to be a robot while her ex-boyfriend repairs the real one that—not so coincidentally—looks exactly like her.

<article class="text-primary">
  But who in the world would be in need of a robot humanoid? The answer is Kim Min Kyu (Yoo Seung Ho), a rich man who suffers from a very rare condition that prevents him from having any kind of contact with people. This is widely inconvenient, especially since this prevents him from winning the heart of his long-time crush. The dynamics between Min Kyu and Ji Ah are far from hilarious and chaotic, since Ji Ah is only human and Min Kyu can’t help but notice her bright charm despite her pretending to be a robot. When the biggest obstacle between you and your lover is none other than yourself, seeing how he overcomes that should be enough to start watching this drama now.

  K-dramas based on contract marriages might be a little outdated now, but when you combine them with time travel, getting revenge on a crazy stepmother, super supportive in-laws, and a very hot husband, you get a pretty perfect drama. And that is exactly why “Perfect Marriage Revenge” doesn’t fall short on the word perfect, offering all of the above plus a strong-minded female lead who isn’t afraid to face those who have hurt her, even if that means to overlook her chances to find true love along the way.

  Han Yi Joo (Jung Yoo Min) and Seo Do Guk (Sung Hoon) might be one of the greatest power couples of 2023. They start off as a contract marriage, but they quickly start to develop a nice friendship full of complicity. They support each other’s plans, understand each other’s insecurities, heal their pain, and ultimately give each other the family they always longed for. Despite the unnerving villains, the sweetness between the main couple and the satisfaction of seeing them team up to bring their enemies down makes this a drama worth watching. Plus, it’s only a 12-episode show, which makes it easier to binge-watch during any weekend.

<!-- 3 Moments In Which The Truth Was Revealed In Episode 13 Of “A Good Day To Be A Dog” -->
<article class="text-primary">The previous episode of “A Good Day to Be a Dog” left things on a heartbreaking note as Jin Seo Won (Cha Eun Woo) was pushed away by his beloved Han Hae Na (Park Gyu Young) since she had lost all of the memories from their time together. The revenge planned by Lee Bo Kyum (Lee Hyun Woo) seemed to have succeeded in some way or another, and with the ending coming very soon for this story, things are finally starting to resolve for our SeoHae couple. We’ve already seen bits of all the characters’ past lives, but we still don’t know the whole picture. And as every story has two sides, it is time for us to know the truth behind it all.</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary font-bold">Warning: spoilers from episode 13 below! </article>
<br/>
<br/>
<article class="w-full text-primary article_medium_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">1. Han Hae Na realizing she lost her memories</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Though it was a really cheap move from Lee Bo Kyum to erase Hae Na’s memories and attempt to date her, this only lasts until Hae Na realizes that though her head might have forgotten her time with Jin Seo Won, her heart remembers the love they felt for each other. She is confused at first as she can’t understand why the affection from Seo Won seems so familiar to her, but he assures her that he will wait until all the pieces come into place and she recovers her memories.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">And soon enough, some clues show up, like the SeoHae couple’s trip marked on her calendar or the pictures of them together. This is when Hae Na comes to the conclusion that something is amiss. She confronts Lee Bo Kyum, who quickly quits the game and orders her to go to the mountain he once guarded as a god. Though she is aware of the risk she is taking, she is willing to make the sacrifice in order to recover her memories, and so is Seo Won, proving that our power couple is here to stay.</article>

<article class="w-full text-primary article_medium_heading font-bold py-2 border-b-2 border-accent">2. Lee Bo Kyum knowing how Cho Young died</article>
<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Once they all arrive at the mountain, it is quite nerve-wracking to see what exactly Lee Bo Kyum is planning to do. But one thing is certain, he is not letting it slide easily as he is dead set on getting his revenge, even if that means turning into a complete monster. If at the beginning of the drama it was unclear whether he was Hae Na’s and Seo Won’s friend or foe, at this point it is crystal clear that he is the main villain of their story.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">However, at the moment when he is ready to end it all, he encounters Cho Young’s (Kim Yi Kyung’s) soul, who returns to the cliff where they used to meet. She shows him the truth behind her death. In reality, Mak Soon (Hae Na in her past life) never betrayed Cho Young, and instead Mak Soon and Soo Hyun (Seo Won in his past life) tried to save her, but it was ultimately Cho Young’s choice to sacrifice her life in order to give Mak Soon’s unborn baby a chance to live. The irony is so clear in the fact that Bo Kyum cursed the baby that Cho Young surrendered her own life for, and the pain and grief behind this is obvious for Lee Bo Kyum as well.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Once in the woods, Hae Na sits on a tree while Seo Won helps her with her wounded foot. This seems to trigger a brief moment of her memories, which makes her wonder how sad it was for him. But Seo Won, sweet as he always is, reassures her saying that it was also his choice, which makes it all the more a loving moment. However, at the same time Bo Kyum is meeting with Cho Young, Seo Won and Hae Na are faced with some wild dogs that are there to kill them.</article>

<br/>
<article class="text-primary">Though Seo Won has already told Hae Na that he is afraid of dogs, he doesn’t hesitate when he sees the wild animals coming toward them, and he tries to protect her with his entire being. This intense moment is all that it takes for Hae Na to recover her memories. And while she sees all the precious moments from their love story, Seo Won welcomes her with a warm embrace, saying how much he missed her. Though for now it looks like love has won, we better prepare our hearts, and maybe some tissues, to say goodbye to this drama this week in the last episode of “A Good Day to Be a Dog”!</article>

    NewJeans’ “Ditto” remains beloved by the public as it was fresh and new when it first came out. Rather than the usual bubbly high school setting, “Ditto” had a tinge of melancholy and a retro vibe that touched the hearts of many who were missing a part of the past. They managed to convey youth and fleetingness all at the same time, using a concept that had been untouched before. The Y2K concept that was popularized by NewJeans was instantly copied by many other artists.

<ul class="article_list_disc text-primary">
    <li>NewJeans is so multi-useful.</li>
    <li>No, but it’s just the 90s vibes…</li>
    <li>It doesn’t make sense to say that they didn’t even reference “Ditto.” They of course referenced it as they filmed it. Not just the retro vibes, but there’s so many angles and scenes that overlap. It’s not plagiarism though.</li>
    <li>It’s way too similar. Of course they referenced it because NewJeans is the most popular LOL. It’s funny to say they didn’t copy them.</li>
    <li>Isn’t it such a common concept that has been around since the past? What NewJeans?</li>
    <li>Honestly, it’s like the boy version of “Ditto.”</li>
    <li>It seems like they referenced it a lot LOL. They don’t have a conscience if they say they didn’t.</li>
    <li>It seems right to say that they tried making it the boy version LOL. It’s good for noise marketing because it becomes a hot topic and the concept is good.</li>
    <li>Through screenshots the vibes are similar indeed.</li>
