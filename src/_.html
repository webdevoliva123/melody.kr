    Stray Kids’s Felix has become the youngest member to join UNICEF’s Honors Club!
<br/>
<br/>
On January 4, the Korean Committee for UNICEF revealed that Felix donated 100 million won (approximately $76,500) to the organization, saying, “Felix, who became the youngest member of the UNICEF’s Honors Club in history and the first member to join in 2024 through this donation, is well-known as a person who has always taken the lead in donation activities for underprivileged neighbors. For this particular instance, he made a donation to help children in Laos who are having difficulties with physical development due to poor drinking water sanitation and nutrition.”
<br/>
<br/>
Felix shared, “I participated in this donation because I wanted to share the love I received. I hope that children in Laos, who suffer from various difficulties due to polluted water, poor hygienic conditions, and insufficient nutrition, will grow up in good health in a safer environment in the new year.”

<!-- Watch: SEVENTEEN And PD Na Young Suk Enjoy Italy In Fun “NANA TOUR” Episode 2 Preview -->
<article class="text-primary">
    Producing director (PD) Na Young Suk’s new variety show “NANA TOUR with SEVENTEEN” has released a fun trailer for Episode 2!
    <br /><br />

“NANA TOUR with SEVENTEEN” is a new travel variety program in which the SEVENTEEN members head to Europe together with Na Young Suk. (Due to his knee injury, S.Coups was unable to participate in filming for the show.)
<br /><br />
On January 6, “NANA TOUR with SEVENTEEN” unveiled a sneak peek of the fun and chaos in store for viewers in Episode 2. The newly released trailer begins with SEVENTEEN expressing their excitement at getting to explore Rome, where they happily take photos and enjoy the city’s delicious food together.
<br /><br />
Next, the SEVENTEEN members head to picturesque Tuscany. However, it wouldn’t be a Na Young Suk show without his signature games, and before the idols can enjoy the view, they need to pass a quiz on the tour bus.
<br /><br />
After repeated failures, the SEVENTEEN members start to unleash their fierce competitive streaks—and as the captions point out, with 12 members, there’s never a dull (or quiet) moment.
<br /><br />
The next episode of “NANA TOUR with SEVENTEEN” will air on January 12. Check out the new preview below!

    NewJeans’ “Ditto” remains beloved by the public as it was fresh and new when it first came out. Rather than the usual bubbly high school setting, “Ditto” had a tinge of melancholy and a retro vibe that touched the hearts of many who were missing a part of the past. They managed to convey youth and fleetingness all at the same time, using a concept that had been untouched before. The Y2K concept that was popularized by NewJeans was instantly copied by many other artists.

    <li>No, but it’s just the 90s vibes…</li>
    <li>It doesn’t make sense to say that they didn’t even reference “Ditto.” They of course referenced it as they filmed it. Not just the retro vibes, but there’s so many angles and scenes that overlap. It’s not plagiarism though.</li>
    <li>It’s way too similar. Of course they referenced it because NewJeans is the most popular LOL. It’s funny to say they didn’t copy them.</li>
    <li>Isn’t it such a common concept that has been around since the past? What NewJeans?</li>
    <li>Honestly, it’s like the boy version of “Ditto.”</li>
    <li>It seems like they referenced it a lot LOL. They don’t have a conscience if they say they didn’t.</li>
    <li>It seems right to say that they tried making it the boy version LOL. It’s good for noise marketing because it becomes a hot topic and the concept is good.</li>
    <li>Through screenshots the vibes are similar indeed.</li>
